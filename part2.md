## Rust likes to Move It, Move It

I'd like to move back a little, and show you something surprising:

```rust
// move1.rs
fn main() {
    let s1 = "hello dolly".to_string();
    let s2 = s1;
    println!("s1 {}",s1);
}
```
And we get the following error:

```
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `s1`
 --> move1.rs:5:22
  |
4 |     let s2 = s1;
  |         -- value moved here
5 |     println!("s1 {}",s1);
  |                      ^^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `s1` has type `std::string::String`,
  which does not implement the `Copy` trait
```
Rust has different behaviour than other languages. In a language where variables are
always references (like Java or Python), `s2` becomes yet another reference to the
string object referenced by `s1`. In C++, `s1` is a value, and it is _copied_ to `s2`.
But Rust moves the value.  It doesn't see strings as copyable
("does not implement the Copy trait").

We would not see this with 'primitive' types like numbers, since they are just values;
they are allowed to be copyable because they are cheap to copy. But `String` has allocated
memory containing "Hello dolly", and copying will involve allocating some more memory
and copying the characters. Rust will not do this silently.

Consider a `String` containing the whole text of 'Moby-Dick'. It's not a big struct,
just has the address in memory of the text, its size, and how big the allocated block is.
Copying this is going to be expensive, because that memory is allocated on the heap and
the copy will need its own allocated block.

```
    | addr | ---------> Call me Ishmael.....
    | size |                    |
    | cap  |                    |
                                |
    | addr | -------------------|
    | size |

    | 8 bytes |
```
The second value is a string slice (`&str`) which refers to the same memory as the string,
with a size - just the guy's name.

The third value is an `f64` - just 8 bytes. It does not refer to any other memory, so
it's just as cheap to copy as to move.

Re-writing with a function call reveals exactly the same error:

```rust
// move2.rs

fn dump(s: String) {
    println!("{}",s);
}

fn main() {
    let s1 = "hello dolly".to_string();
    dump(s1);
    println!("s1 {}",s1);
}
```
Here, you have a choice. You may explicitly create a reference to that string, or
explicitly copy it using its `clone` method.  Generally, the first is the better way
to go.

```rust
fn dump(s: &String) {
    println!("{}",s);
}
```
The call becomes `dump(&s1)`, and the error goes away. But you'll rarely see a plain
`String` reference like this, since to pass a string literal is really ugly _and_ involves
creating a temporary string.

```rust
    dump(&"hello world".to_string());
```
So altogether the best way to declare that function is:

```rust
fn dump(s: &str) {
    println!("{}",s);
}
```

And then both `dump(&s1)` and `dump("hello world")` work properly.

## Lifetimes

So, the rule of thumb is to prefer to keep references to the original data - to 'borrow'
it.

But a reference must _not_ outlive the owner!

First, Rust is a _block-scoped_ language. Variables only exist for the duration of their
block:

```rust
{
    let a = 10;
    let b = "hello";
    {
        let c = "hello".to_string();
        // a,b and c are visible
    } // the string c is dropped
    // a,b are visible
    for i in 0..a {
        let b = &b[1..];
        // original b is no longer visible - it is shadowed.
    }
    // the slice b is dropped
    // i is _not_ visible!
}
```
Loop variables (like `i`) are a little different, they are only visible in the loop
block.  It is not an error to create a new variable using the same name ('shadowing')
but it can be confusing.

When a variable 'goes out of scope' then it is _dropped_. Any memory used is reclaimed,
and any other _resources_ owned by that variable are given back to the system - for
instance, dropping a `File` closes it.  This is a Good Thing. Unused resources are
reclaimed immediately when not needed.

(A further Rust-specific issue is that a variable may appear to be in scope, but its
value has moved.)

Here a reference `rs1` is made to a value `tmp` which only lives for the duration
of its block:

```rust
01 // ref1.rs
02 fn main() {
03    let s1 = "hello dolly".to_string();
04    let mut rs1 = &s1;
05    {
06        let tmp = "hello world".to_string();
07        rs1 = &tmp;
08    }
09    println!("ref {}",rs1);
10 }
```
We borrow the value of `s1` and then borrow the value of `tmp`. But `tmp`'s value
does not exist outside that block:

```
error: `tmp` does not live long enough
  --> ref1.rs:8:5
   |
7  |         rs1 = &tmp;
   |                --- borrow occurs here
8  |     }
   |     ^ `tmp` dropped here while still borrowed
9  |     println!("ref {}",rs1);
10 | }
   | - borrowed value needs to live until here
```
Where is `tmp`? Gone, dead, gone back to the Big Heap in the Sky: _dropped_.
Rust is here saving you from the dreaded 'dangling pointer' problem of C -
a reference that points to stale data.

## Tuples

It's sometimes very useful to return multiple values from a function. Tuples are
the solution:

```rust
// tuple1.rs

fn add_mul(x: f64, y: f64) -> (f64,f64) {
    (x+y, x*y)
}

fn main() {
    let t = add_mul(2.0,10.0);

    // can debug print
    println!("t {:?}",t);

    // can 'index' the values
    println!("add {} mul {}",t.0,t.1);

    // can _extract_ values
    let (add,mul) = t;
    println!("add {} mul {}",add,mul);
}
// t (12, 20)
// add 12 mul 20
// add 12 mul 20
```
The `let (add,mul) = t` construct is similar to that found in Python, except it only works
with tuple values, not any source of values.

Tuples may contain _different_ types, which is the main difference from arrays.

```rust
let tuple = ("hello", 5, 'c');

assert_eq!(tuple.0, "hello");
assert_eq!(tuple.1, 5);
assert_eq!(tuple.2, 'c');
```
They appear in some `Iterator` methods. This is like the Python generator
of the same name:

```rust
    for (i,s) in ["zero","one","two"].iter().enumerate() {
        print!(" {} {};",i,s);
    }
    //  0 zero; 1 one; 2 two;
```
`zip` is specifically for combining two iterators into a single iterator of
tuples containing the values:

```rust
    let names = ["ten","hundred","thousand"];
    let nums = [10,100,1000];
    for (name,num) in names.iter().zip(nums.iter()) {
        print!(" {} {};",name,num);
    }
    //  ten 10; hundred 100; thousand 1000;
```

## Structs

Tuples are convenient, but saying `t.1` and keeping track of the meaning of each part
is tedious for anything that isn't straightforward.

Rust _structs_ contain named _fields_:

```rust
// struct1.rs

struct Person {
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String
}

fn main() {
    let p = Person {
        first_name: "John".to_string(),
        last_name: "Smith".to_string()
    };
    println!("person {} {}",p.first_name,p.last_name);
}
```

The values of a struct will be placed next to each other in memory, although you should
not assume any particular memory layout - the compiler will organize the memory for
efficiency, not size, and so there will be padding. A `struct` should be familiar to C or
C++ programmers.

Initializing this struct is a bit clumsy, so we want to move the construction of a `Person`
into its own function. This function can be made into a _method_ of `Person` by putting
it into a `impl` block:

```rust
// struct2.rs

struct Person {
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String
}

impl Person {

    fn new(first: &str, name: &str) -> Person {
        Person {
            first_name: first.to_string(),
            last_name: name.to_string()
        }
    }

}

fn main() {
    let p = Person::new("John","Smith");
    println!("person {} {}",p.first_name,p.last_name);
}
```
There is nothing magic or reserved about the name `new` here. Note that it's accessed
using a C++-like notation (what C++ would call in its usual clunky way a 'static member
function'.)

Here's a another `Person` method, but with a _reference self_ argument:

```rust
impl Person {
    ...

    fn full_name(&self) -> String {
        format!("{} {}",self.first_name, self.last_name)
    }

}
...
    println!("fullname {}",p.full_name());
// fullname John Smith
```
The `self` is used explicitly (unlike the `this` of C++) and is passed as a reference.
(You can think of `&self` as `self: &Person`.)

The keyword `Self` refers to the struct type - you can mentally substitute `Person`
for `Self` here:

```rust
    fn copy(&self) -> Self {
        Self::new(&self.first_name,&self.last_name)
    }
```

Methods may allow the data to be modified using a _mutable self_ argument:

```rust
    fn set_first_name(&mut self, name: &str) {
        self.first_name = name.to_string();
    }
```
And the data will _move_ into the method when a plain self argument is used:

```rust
    fn to_tuple(self) -> (String,String) {
        (self.first_name, self.last_name)
    }
```
(Try that with `&self` - structs will not let go of their data without a fight!)

If you try to do a debug dump of a `Person`, you will get an informative error:

```
error[E0277]: the trait bound `Person: std::fmt::Debug` is not satisfied
  --> struct2.rs:23:21
   |
23 |     println!("{:?}",p);
   |                     ^ the trait `std::fmt::Debug` is not implemented for `Person`
   |
   = note: `Person` cannot be formatted using `:?`; if it is defined in your crate,
    add `#[derive(Debug)]` or manually implement it
   = note: required by `std::fmt::Debug::fmt`
```
The compiler is giving advice, so we put `#[derive(Debug)]` in front of `Person`, and now
there is sensible output:

```
Person { first_name: "John", last_name: "Smith" }
```

The _directive_ makes the compiler generate a `Debug` implementation, which is very
helpful. It's good practice to do this for your structs, so they can be
printed out (or written as a string using `format!`).  (Doing so _by default_ would be
very un-Rustlike.)

## Lifetimes Start to Bite

Usually structs contain values, but often they also need to contain references.
Say we want to put a string slice, not a string value, in a struct.

```rust
// life1.rs

#[derive(Debug)]
struct A {
    s: &str
}

fn main() {
    let a = A { s: "hello dammit" };

    println!("{:?}",a);
}
```

```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> life1.rs:5:8
  |
5 |     s: &str
  |        ^ expected lifetime parameter
```
To understand the complaint, you have to see the problem from the point of view of Rust.
It will not allow a reference to be stored without knowing its lifetime. Because all
references are borrowed from some value, and values have lifetimes. The lifetime of
a reference cannot be longer than the lifetime of that value.
Rust cannot allow
a situation where that reference could suddenly become invalid.

Now, there are basically two kinds of string slices; those that refer to _string literals_
like "hello" and those that borrow from `String` values. String literals exist for the duration
of the whole program, which is called the 'static' lifetime.

So this works - we assure Rust that the string slice always refers to such static strings:

```rust
// life2.rs

#[derive(Debug)]
struct A {
    s: &'static str
}

fn main() {
    let a = A { s: "hello dammit" };

    println!("{:?}",a);
}
// A { s: "hello dammit" }
```
It is not the most _pretty_ notation, but sometimes ugliness is the necessary
price of being precise.

This can also be used to specify a string slice that is returned from a function:

```rust
fn how(i: u32) -> &'static str {
    match i {
    0: 'none',
    1: 'one',
    _: 'many'
    }
}
```
That works for the special case of static strings, but this is very restrictive. However
we can specify that the lifetime of the reference is _as least as long_ as that of
the struct itself.

```rust
// life3.rs

#[derive(Debug)]
struct A <'a> {
    s: &'a str
}

fn main() {
    let string = "I'm a little string".to_string();
    let a = A { s: &string };

    println!("{:?}",a);
}
```
Lifetimes are conventionally called 'a','b',etc but you could just as well called it
'me' here.

Sometimes it seems like a good idea for a struct to contain a value _and_ a reference
that borrows from that value.
It's basically impossible because structs must be _moveable_, and any move will
invalidate the reference.  It isn't necessary to do this - for instance, if your
struct has a string field, and needs to provide slices, then it could keep indices
and have a method to generate the actual slices.



## Traits

Please note that Rust does not spell `struct` _class_. The keyword `class` in other
languages is so overloaded with meaning that it effectively shuts down original thinking.

Let's put it like this: Rust structs cannot _inherit_ from other structs; they are
all unique types. There is no _sub-typing_.

So how _does_ one establish relationships between types? This is where _traits_ come in.

`rustc` often talks about `implementing X trait` and so it's time to talk about traits
properly.


Here's a little example of defining a trait and _implementing_ it for a particular type.

```rust
// trait1.rs

trait Show {
    fn show(&self) -> String;
}

impl Show for i32 {
    fn show(&self) -> String {
        format!("four-byte unsigned {}",self)
    }
}

impl Show for f64 {
    fn show(&self) -> String {
        format!("eight-byte float {}",self)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let answer = 42;
    let maybe_pi = 3.14;
    let s1 = answer.show();
    let s2 = maybe_pi.show();
    println!("show {}",s1);
    println!("show {}",s2);
}
// show four-byte signed 42
// show eight-byte float 3.14
```
It's pretty cool; we have _added a new method_ to both `i32` and `f64`!

Getting comfortable with Rust involves learning the basic traits of the
standard library (they tend to hunt in packs.)

`Debug` is very common.
We gave `Person` a default implementation with the
convenient `#[derive(Debug)]`, but say we want a `Person` to display as its full name:

```rust
use std::fmt;

impl fmt::Debug for Person {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{}", self.full_name())
    }
}
...
    println!("{:?}",p);
    // John Smith
```
`write!` is a very useful macro - here `f` is anything that implements `Write`.
(This would also work with a `File` - or even a `String`.)

Now, with the implementations of `Show` in `trait1.rs`, here's a
little main program with big implications:

```rust
fn main() {
    let answer = 42;
    let maybe_pi = 3.14;
    let v: Vec<&Show> = vec![&answer,&maybe_pi];
    for d in v.iter() {
        println!("show {}",d.show());
    }
}
// show four-byte signed 42
// show eight-byte float 3.14
```
This is a case where Rust needs some type guidance - I specifically want a vector
of references to anything that implements `Show`.  Now note that `i32` and `f64`
have no relationship to each other, but they both understand the `show` method
because they both implement the same trait. This method is _virtual_, because
the actual function has different code for different types, and yet the correct
method is invoked based on _runtime_ information. These references
are called [trait objects](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/trait-objects.html).

And _that_ is how you can put objects of different types in the same vector. If
you come from a Java background, you can think of `Show` as an interface; the
nearest C++ equivalent is "abstract base class".

## Example: iterator over floating-point range

We have met ranges before (`0..n`) but they don't work for floating-point values. (You
can _force_ this but you'll end up with a step of 1.0 which is uninteresting.)

Recall the informal definition of an iterator; it is an struct with a `next` method
which may return `Some`-thing or `None`. In the process, the iterator itself gets modified,
it keeps the state for the iteration (like next index and so forth.) The data that
is being iterated over doesn't change usually, (But see `std::vec::Vec::drain` for an
interesting iterator that does modify its data.)

And here is the formal definition: the `Iterator` trait:

```rust
trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
    ...
}
```
Here we meet an [associated type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/associated-types.html) of the `Iterator` trait.
This trait must work for any type, so you must specify that return type somehow.
The method can then be written without using a
particular type - instead it refers to that type parameter's `Item` via `Self`.

The iterator trait for `f64` is written `Iterator<Item=f64>`, which can be read as
"an Iterator with its associated type Item set to f64".

The `...` refers to the _default methods_ of `Iterator`. You only need to define `Item`
and `next`, and the default methods fill out the rest.

```rust
// trait3.rs

struct FRange {
    val: f64,
    end: f64,
    incr: f64
}

fn range(x1: f64, x2: f64, skip: f64) -> FRange {
    FRange {val: x1, end: x2, incr: skip}
}

impl Iterator for FRange {
    type Item = f64;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let res = self.val;
        if res >= self.end {
            None
        } else {
            self.val += self.incr;
            Some(res)
        }
    }
}


fn main() {
    for x in range(0.0, 1.0, 0.1) {
        println!("{} ",x);
    }
}
```
And the rather messy looking result is

```
0
0.1
0.2
0.30000000000000004
0.4
0.5
0.6
0.7
0.7999999999999999
0.8999999999999999
0.9999999999999999
```
This is because 0.1 is not precisely representable as a float, so a little formatting
help is needed. Replace the `println!` with this

```rust
println!("{:.1} ",x);
```
And we get cleaner output (this format means 'one decimal after dot'.)

All of the default iterator methods are available, so we can collect these values into
a vector:

```rust
    let v: Vec<f64> = range(0.0, 1.0, 0.1).collect();
```
This is a common pattern and it gets irritating. Fortunately, it's easy to
add new 'consumers' of iterators. These are those methods that end the chain and
'pull' all the values of the iterator, like `count` - or `collect`.

We will define a new trait `ToVec` which has an associated type, just like an `Iterator`.
It will be the type contained in the returned vector.

```rust
trait ToVec {
    type Item;

    fn to_vec(self) -> Vec<Self::Item>;
}
```

And now we'll implement `ToVec` for `Iterator`. All that `Vec` requires of its elements is that they
have a size. (Traits, being abstract, have no size.) The actual iterator type `I`
must implement `Iterator` with its associated type `Item` set to `T`, the element
type. There is only one free type parameter `T` since `I` is defined in terms of `T`.

Alternatively: This implementation of `ToVec` has type parameters `T` and `I`. `T` must implement `Size` to
make `Vec` happy. `I` is any concrete type that implements an iterator for values of
the type `T`.

The actual implementation is delegated to the `FromIterator` trait, which is
defined for vectors.

```rust
impl <T,I> ToVec for I
where T: Sized, I: Iterator<Item=T> {
    type Item = T;

    fn to_vec(self) -> Vec<Self::Item> {
        FromIterator::from_iter(self)
    }
}
    ....
    let v = range(0.0, 1.0, 0.1).to_vec();
```
Et voilà! No more awkwardness! The implementation was a little scary, but familiarity
breeds acceptance.

## Simple Enums

Enums are types which have a few definite values. For instance, a direction has
only four possible values.

```rust
enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right
}
...
    // `start` is type `Direction`
    let start = Direction::Left;
```
They can have methods defined on them, just like structs.
The  `match` expression is the basic way to handle `enum` values.

```rust
impl Direction {
    fn as_str(&self) -> &'static str {
        match *self {
        Direction::Up => "Up",
        Direction::Down => "Down",
        Direction::Left => "Left",
        Direction::Right => "Right"
        }
    }
}
```
Both the typename and `self` are explicit in Rust, unlike C++. This is generally a
good idea, because the baroque way C++ resolves names is a little too clever for normal
humans. (And there is a shortcut, as we will see.)

Punctuation matters. Note that `*` before `self`. It's easy to forget, because often
Rust will assume it (we said `self.first_name`, not `*self.first_name`). However,
matching is a more exact business. Leaving it out would give a whole spew of messages,
which boil down to this type mismatch:

```
   = note: expected type `&Direction`
   = note:    found type `Direction`
```
This is because `self` has type `&Direction`, so we have to throw in the `*` to
_deference_ the value.

Like structs, enums can implement traits, and our friend `#[derive(Debug)]` can
be added to `Direction`:

```rust
        println!("start {:?}",start);
        // start Left
```
So that `as_str` method isn't really necessary, since we can always get the name from `Debug`.
(But it does _not allocate_, which may be important.)

You should not assume any particular ordering here - there's no implied integer
'ordinal' value.

Here's a method which defines the 'successor' of each `Direction` value. The
very handy _wildcard use_ temporarily puts the enum names into the method context:

```rust
    fn inc(&self) -> Direction {
        use Direction::*;
        match *self {
        Up => Right,
        Right => Down,
        Down => Left,
        Left => Up
        }
    }
    ...

    let mut d = start;
    for _ in 0..8 {
        println!("d {:?}",d);
        d = d.inc();
    }
    // d Left
    // d Up
    // d Right
    // d Down
    // d Left
    // d Up
    // d Right
    // d Down
```
So this will cycle endlessly through the various directions in this particular, arbitrary,
order. It is (in fact) a very simple _state machine_.

Out of the box, these values can't be compared:

```
assert_eq!(start,Direction::Left);

error[E0369]: binary operation `==` cannot be applied to type `Direction`
  --> enum1.rs:42:5
   |
42 |     assert_eq!(start,Direction::Left);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
note: an implementation of `std::cmp::PartialEq` might be missing for `Direction`
  --> enum1.rs:42:5
```

The solution is to say `#[derive(Debug,PartialEq)]` in front of `enum Direction`.


This is an important point - Rust user-defined types start out fresh and unadorned.
You give them sensible default behaviours by implementing the common traits. This
applies also to structs - if you ask for Rust to derive `PartialEq` for a struct it
will do the sensible thing, assume that all fields implement it and build up
a comparison. If this isn't so, or you want to redefine equality, then you are free
to define `PartialEq` explicitly.

Rust does 'C style enums' as well:

```rust
// enum2.rs

enum Speed {
    Slow = 10,
    Medium = 20,
    Fast = 50
}

fn main() {
    let s = Speed::Slow;
    let speed = s as u32;
    println!("speed {}",speed);
}
```
They are initialized with an integer value, and can be converted into that integer
with a type cast. It's essentially a convenient way to create a set of constants.

Like with C enums, you only need to give the first name a value, and thereafter the
value goes up by one each time.

By the way, 'name' is too vague, like saying 'thingy' all the time. The proper term here
is _variant_.

These enums _do_ have a natural ordering, but you have to ask nicely.
After placing `#[derive(PartialEq,PartialOrd)]` in front of `enum Speed`, then it's indeed
true that `Speed::Fast > Speed::Slow`.

## Enums in their Full Glory

Rust enums in their full form are like C unions on steroids, like a Ferrari compared
to a Fiat Uno. Consider the problem of storing different values in a type-safe way.

```rust
// enum3.rs

#[derive(Debug)]
enum Value {
    Number(f64),
    Str(String),
    Bool(bool)
}

fn main() {
    use Value::*;
    let n = Number(2.3);
    let s = Str("hello".to_string());
    let b = Bool(true);

    println!("n {:?} s {:?} b {:?}",n,s,b);
}
// n Number(2.3) s Str("hello") b Bool(true)
```
Again, this enum can only contain _one_ of these values; its size will be the size of
the largest variant.

So far, not really a supercar, although it's cool that they know how to print themselves
out. But they also know how _what kind_ of value they contain, and _that_ is the
superpower of `match`.

Let me give you a function with a mistake. We want to print out a custom string based
on the _Value_'s contained type, and we want to pass it as a reference, because otherwise
a move would take place and the value would be eaten:

```rust
fn dump(v: &Value) {
    use Value::*;
    match *v {
    Number(n) => println!("number is {}",n),
    Str(s) => println!("string is '{}'",s),
    Bool(b) => println!("boolean is {}",b)
    }
}
```
```
error[E0507]: cannot move out of borrowed content
  --> enum3.rs:12:11
   |
12 |     match *v {
   |           ^^ cannot move out of borrowed content
13 |     Number(n) => println!("number is {}",n),
14 |     Str(s) => println!("string is '{}'",s),
   |         - hint: to prevent move, use `ref s` or `ref mut s`
```
There are things you cannot do with borrowed references. Rust is not letting
you _extract_ the string contained in the original value. It did not complain about `Number`
because it's happy to copy `f64`, but `String` does not implement `Copy`.

I mentioned earlier that `match` is picky about _exact_ types
- here we follow the hint and things will work; now we are just borrowing a reference
to that contained string.

```rust
fn dump(v: &Value) {
    use Value::*;
    match *v {
    Number(n) => println!("number is {}",n),
    Str(ref s) => println!("string is '{}'",s),
    Bool(b) => println!("boolean is {}",b)
    }
}
    ....

    dump(&s);
    // string is 'hello'
```
Before we move on, filled with the euphoria of a successful Rust compilation, let's
pause a little. `rustc` is unusually good at generating errors that have enough
context for a human to fix the error without necessarily _understanding_ the error.

The issue is a combination of the exactness of matching, with the determination of the
borrow checker to foil any attempt to break the Rules.  One of those Rules is that
you cannot yank out a value which belongs to some owning type. Some knowledge of
C++ is a hindrance here, since `c++` will copy its way out of the problem, whether that
copy even _makes sense_.  You will get exactly the same error if you try to pull out
a value from a vector, say with `*v[0]` (`*` because indexing returns references.)
It will simply not let you do this. (_Sometimes_ `clone` isn't such a bad solution to this.)

As for `match`, you can see `Str(s) =>` as short for `Str(s: String) =>`. A local variable
(often called a _binding_) is created.  Often that inferred type is cool, when you
eat up a value and extract its contents. But here we really needed is `s: &String`, and the
`ref` is a hint that ensures this: we just want to borrow that string.

Here is a method that really does eat up a `Value`. It's a classic use of `Option`,
because either that value contained a string, or it didn't.

Look carefully (punctuation matters!) - the method signature is now plain `self`, and
the `*` has dropped. The `self` argument is _moved_ into the method.

Here we do want to extract that string, and don't care about
the enum value afterwards.

```rust
impl Value {
    fn to_str(self) -> Option<String> {
        match self {
        Value::Str(s) => Some(s),
        _ => None
        }
    }
}
    ...
    println!("s? {:?}",s.to_str());
    // (s is now dead, moved, dropped, etc)
    // s? Some("hello")
```
Naming also matters - this is called `to_str`, not `as_str`. You can write a
method that just borrows that string as an `Option<&String>` (The reference will need
the same lifetime as the enum value.)  But you would not call it `to_str`.

You can write `to_str` like this - it is completely equivalent:

```rust
    fn to_str(self) -> Option<String> {
        if let Value::Str(s) = self {
            Some(s)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
```

## More about Matching

Recall that the values of a tuple can be extracted with '()':

```rust
    let t = (10,"hello".to_string());
    ...
    let (n,s) = t;
    // t has been moved. It is No More
    // n is i32, s is String
```

This is a special case of _destructuring_; we have some
data and wish to either pull it apart (like here) or just borrow its values.
Either way, we get the parts of a structure.

The syntax used for borrowing is just like that used in `match`.


```rust
    let (ref n,ref s) = t;
    // n and s are borrowed from t. It still lives!
    // n is &i32, s is &String
```

Destructuring works with structs as well:

```rust
    struct Point {
        x: f32,
        y: f32
    }

    let p = Point{x:1.0,y:2.0};
    ...
    let Point{x,y} = p;
    // p still lives, since x and y can be copied
    // both x and y are f32
```

Time to revisit `match` with some new patterns. The first is exactly like a `let`
destructuring - it only matches tuples with first element zero, but _any_ string;
the second adds an `if` so that it only matches `(1,"hello")`.

Finally, just a variable matches _anything_. This is useful if the `match` applies
to an expression and you don't want to bind a variable to that expression. `_` works
like a variable but is ignored (`_` behaves rather like it does in Go.) It's a common
way to finish off a `match`, like `default` in C `switch` statements.

```rust
fn match_tuple(t: (i32,String)) {
    let text = match t {
        (0, s) => format!("zero {}", s),
        (1, ref s) if s == "hello" => format!("hello one!"),
        tt => format!("no match {:?}", tt)
     };
    println!("{}", text);
}
```

Why not just match against `(1,"hello")`? Matching is an exact business, and the compiler
complains:

```
  = note: expected type `std::string::String`
  = note:    found type `&'static str`
```

Why do we need `ref s`? It's a slightly obscure gotcha (look up the E00008 error) where
if you have an _if guard_ you need to borrow, since the if guard happens in a different
context, a move will take place otherwise. It's a case of the implementation leaking
ever so slightly.

If the type _was_ `&str` then we match it directly:

```rust
    match (42,"answer") {
        (42,"answer") => println!("yes"),
        _ => println!("no")
    };
```

What applies to `match` applies to `if let`. This is a cool example, since if we
get a `Some`, we can match inside it and only extract the string from the tuple. So it
isn't necessary to have nested `if let` statements here.

```rust
    let ot = Some((2,"hello".to_string());

    if let Some((_,ref s)) = ot {
        assert_eq!(s,"hello");
    }
    // we just borrowed the string, no 'destructive destructuring'
```

An interesting problem happens when using `parse` (or any function which needs to work
out its return type from context)

```rust
    if let Some(n) = "42".parse() {
        ...
    }
```

So what's the type of `n`? You have to give a hint somehow - what kind of integer? Is it
even an integer?

```rust
    if let Some(n) = "42".parse::<i32>() {
        ...
    }
```

This somewhat non-elegant syntax is called the 'turbofish operator'. Otherwise, it
would be even more non-elegant:

```rust
    let maybe_n: Option<i32> = "42".parse();
    if let Some(n) = maybe_n {
        ...
    }
```

## Closures

A great deal of Rust's power comes from _closures_. In their simplest form, they
act like shortcut functions:

```rust
    let f = |x| x*x;

    let res = f(10);

    println!("res {}",res);
    // res 100
```

There are no explicit types in this example - everything is deduced, starting with the
integer literal 10.

We get an error if we call `f` on different types - Rust has already decided that
`f` must be called on an integer type:

```
    let res = f(10);

    let resf = f(1.2);
  |
8 |     let resf = f(1.2);
  |                  ^^^ expected integral variable, found floating-point variable
  |
  = note: expected type `{integer}`
  = note:    found type `{float}`

```

So, the first call fixes the type of the argument `x`. It's equivalent to this function:

```rust
    fn f (x: i32) -> i32 {
        x*x
    }
```

But there's a big difference between functions and closures, _apart_ from the need for explicit typing.
Here we evaluate a linear function:

```rust
    let m = 2.0;
    let c = 1.0;

    let lin = |x| m*x + c;

    println!("res {} {}", lin(1.0), lin(2.0));
    // res 3 5
```

You cannot do this with the explicit `fn` form - it does not know about variables
in the enclosing scope. The closure has _borrowed_ `m` and `c` from its context.

The usual Rules of Borrowing apply. This works fine - our little closure is borrowing
`answer` mutably.

```rust
let mut answer = 42;

let set = |v| answer = v;

//let get = || answer;

set(58);
assert_eq! (answer, 58);
```

But uncomment `get` and you get a borrowing error:
"cannot borrow `answer` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable"

Now, what's the type of `lin`? Only `rustc` knows. Exactly the same situation applies
to C++ lambdas, and for exactly the same version. Under the hood, a closure is a _struct_
that implements the call operator. All closures are unique types
- but they have traits in common.

So even though we don't know the exact type, we know the generic constraint:

```rust
fn apply<F>(x: f64, f: F) -> f64
where F: Fn(f64)->f64  {
    f(x)
}
...
    let res1 = apply(3.0,lin);
    let res2 = apply(3.14, |x| x.sin());
```

In English: `apply` works for _any_ type `T` such that `T` implements `Fn(f64)->f64` - that
is, is a function which takes `f64` and returns `f64`.

After the call to `apply(3.0,lin)`, trying to access `lin` gives an interesting error:

```
    let l = lin;
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `lin`
  --> closure2.rs:22:9
   |
16 |     let res = apply(3.0,lin);
   |                         --- value moved here
...
22 |     let l = lin;
   |         ^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `lin` has type
    `[closure@closure2.rs:12:15: 12:26 m:&f64, c:&f64]`,
     which does not implement the `Copy` trait

```

That's it, `apply` ate our closure. And there's the actual type of the struct that
`rustc` made up to implement it.

Thinking of closures as structs is useful because they are _values_ and it's
important to know what happens when values move.  Here's a closure that refers to a
string.

```rust
    fn call<F>(ch: char, f: F)
    where F: Fn(char)->bool {
        let res = f(ch);
        println!("{}", res);
    }

    let s = "hello dolly".to_string();

    call('d',|c| s.find(c).is_some());

```

Thinking of calling a closure as a _method call_ makes it easy to understand the
three kinds of function traits - they are the three kinds of methods:

  - `Fn` struct passed as `&self`
  - `FnMut` struct passed as `&mut self`
  - `FnOnce` struct passed as `self`

So it's possible for a closure to mutate its _captured_ references:

```rust
    fn mutate<F>(mut f: F)
    where F: FnMut() {
        f()
    }
    let mut s = "world";
    mutate(|| s = "hello");
    assert_eq!(s,"hello");
```

Note that `mut` - `f` needs to be mutable for this to work.

At this point, if you are used to languages like JavaScript or Lua, you may wonder at the
apparent complexity of closures compared with how straightforward they are in those languages.
This is the necessary cost of Rust's promise to not sneakily make any allocations. In JavaScript,
the equivalent `mutate(function() {s = "hello";})` will always result in a dynamically
allocated closure.

You can of course explicitly create a dynamically allocated closure in Rust using `Box::new`.
This solves the problem of keeping a collection of different closures that implement the
same trait.  The `Box` struct is fed a
value, allocates enough memory for it on the heap, and moves that value to the heap.
A `Box` always has the same size (it's basically a smart pointer.) so we're good to go.

Here's a first try:

```rust
    let mut v = Vec::new();
    v.push(Box::new(|x| x*x));
    v.push(Box::new(|x| x/2.0));

    for f in v.iter() {
        let res = f(1.0);
        println!("res {}",res);
    }
```

We get a very definite error on the second push:

```
  = note: expected type `[closure@closure4.rs:4:21: 4:28]`
  = note:    found type `[closure@closure4.rs:5:21: 5:28]`
note: no two closures, even if identical, have the same type
```

`rustc` has deduced a type which is too specific, so it's necessary to force that
vector to have the _boxed trait type_ before things just work:

```rust
    let mut v: Vec<Box<Fn(f64)->f64>> = Vec::new();
```

You can use these boxed closures to implement callbacks and so forth. If you want to keep
these boxed closures in a struct, then you will need a lifetime annotation, because
_closures borrow variables_ and so their lifetime is tied to the lifetime of those
variables.

Sometimes you don't want a closure to borrow those variables, but instead _move_ them.

```rust
    let name = "dolly".to_string();
    let age = 42;

    let c = move || {
        println!("name {} age {}",name,age);
    };

    c();

    println!("name {}",name);
```

And the error at the last `println` is: "use of moved value: `name`". So one solution
here - if we _did_ want to keep `name` alive - is to move a cloned copy into the closure:

```rust
    let cname = name.to_string();
    let c = move || {
        println!("name {} age {}",cname,age);
    }
```
Why are moved closures needed? Because we might need to call them at a point where
the original context no longer exists. A classic case is when creating a _thread_.

A major use of closures is within iterator methods. Recall the `range` iterator we
defined to go over a range of floating-point numbers. It's straightforward to operate
on this (or any other iterator) using closures:

```rust
    let sine: Vec<f64> = range(0.0,1.0,0.1).map(|x| x.sin()).collect();
```

`map` isn't defined on vectors (although it's easy enough to create a trait that does this),
because then _every_ map  will create a new vector.  This way, we have a choice. In this
sum, no temporary objects are created:

```rust
 let sum: f64 = range(0.0,1.0,0.1).map(|x| x.sin()).sum();
```

It will (in fact) be as fast as writing it out as an explicit loop!

`filter` is another useful iterator method - it only lets through values that match
a condition:

```rust
    let tuples = [(10,"ten"),(20,"twenty"),(30,"thirty"),(40,"forty")];
    let ti = tuples.iter();
    let iter = ti.filter(|t| t.0 > 20).map(|t| t.1);

    for name in iter {
        print!("{} ",name);
    }
```

## The Three Kinds of Iterators

The three kinds correspond (again) to the three basic argument types. Assume we
have a vector of `String` values. Here are the iterator types explicitly, and
then _implicitly_, together with the actual type returned by the iterator.

```rust
for s in vec.iter() {...} // &String
for s in vec.iter_mut() {...} // &mut String
for s in vec.into_iter() {...} // String

// implicit!
for s in &vec {...} // &String
for s in &mut vec {...} // &mut String
for s in vec {...} // String
```
Personally I prefer being explicit, but it's important to understand both forms,
and their implications.

`into_iter` _consumes_ the vector and extracts its strings,
and so afterwards the vector is no longer available - it has been moved. It's
a definite gotcha for Pythonistas used to saying `for s in vec`!

 So the
implicit form `for s in &vec` is usually the one you want, just as `&T` is a good
default in passing arguments to functions.

It's important to understand how the three kinds works because Rust relies heavily
on type deduction - you won't often see explicit types in closure arguments. And this
is a Good Thing, because it would be noisy if all those types were explicitly
_typed out_. However, the price of this compact code is that you need to know
what the implicit types actually are!

`map` takes whatever value the iterator returns and converts it into something else,
but `filter` takes a _reference_ to that value. In this case, we're using `iter` so
the iterator return type is `&String`. Note that `filter` receives a reference to this type.

```rust
for n in vec.iter().map(|x: &String| x.len()) {...} // n is usize
for s in vec.iter().filter(|x: &&String| x.len() > 2) {...}
```

When calling methods, Rust will derefence automatically, so the problem isn't obvious.
But `|x: &&String| x == "one"|` will _not_ work, because operators are more strict
about type matching. `rustc` will complain that there is no such operator that
compares `&&String` and `&str`. So you need an explicit deference to make that `&&String`
into a `&String` which _does_ match.

```rust
for s in vec.iter().filter(|x: &&String| *x == "one") {...}
```

If you leave out the explicit type, you can modify the argument so that the type of `s`
is now `&String`:

```rust
for s in vec.iter().filter(|&x| x == "one")
```

And that's usually how you will see it written.

## Structs with Dynamic Data

A most powerful technique is _a struct that contain references to itself_.

Here is the basic building block of a _binary tree_, expressed in C (everyone's
favourite old relative with a frightening fondness for using power tools without
protection.)

```rust
    struct Node {
        const char *payload;
        struct Node *left;
        struct Node *right;
    };
```

You can not do this by _directly_ including `Node` fields, because then the size of
`Node` depends on the size of `Node`... it just doesn't compute. So we use pointers
to `Node` structs, since the size of a pointer is always known.

If `left` isn't `NULL`, the `Node` will have a left pointing to another node, and so
moreorless indefinitely.

Rust does not do `NULL` (at least not _safely_) so it's clearly a job for `Option`.
But you cannot just put a `Node` in that `Option`, because we don't know the size
of `Node` (and so forth.)  This is a job for `Box`, since it contains a allocated
pointer to the data, and always has a fixed size.

So here's the Rust equivalent, using `type` to create an alias:

```rust
type NodeBox = Option<Box<Node>>;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    payload: String,
    left: NodeBox,
    right: NodeBox
}
```
(Rust is forgiving in this way - no need for forward declarations.)

And a first test program:

```rust
impl Node {
    fn new(s: &str) -> Node {
        Node{payload: s.to_string(), left: None, right: None}
    }

    fn boxer(node: Node) -> NodeBox {
        Some(Box::new(node))
    }

    fn set_left(&mut self, node: Node) {
        self.left = Self::boxer(node);
    }

    fn set_right(&mut self, node: Node) {
        self.right = Self::boxer(node);
    }

}


fn main() {
    let mut root = Node::new("root");
    root.set_left(Node::new("left"));
    root.set_right(Node::new("right"));

    println!("arr {:#?}",root);
}
```
The output is surprisingly pretty, thanks to "{:#?}" ('#' means 'extended'.)

```
root Node {
    payload: "root",
    left: Some(
        Node {
            payload: "left",
            left: None,
            right: None
        }
    ),
    right: Some(
        Node {
            payload: "right",
            left: None,
            right: None
        }
    )
}
```
Now, what happens when `root` is dropped? All fields are dropped; if the 'branches' of
the tree are dropped, they drop _their_ fields and so on. `Box::new` may be the
closest you will get to a `new` keyword, but we have no need for `delete` or `free`.

We must know work out what use such a tree is. Note that strings can be ordered:
'bar' < 'foo', 'abba' > 'aardvark'; so-called 'alphabetical order'.

 Here is a method which inserts nodes in _lexical order_ of the strings:

```rust
    fn insert(&mut self, data: &str) {
        if data < &self.payload {
            match self.left {
            Some(ref mut n) => n.insert(data),
            None => self.set_left(Self::new(data)),
            }
        } else {
            match self.right {
            Some(ref mut n) => n.insert(data),
            None => self.set_right(Self::new(data)),
            }
        }
    }

    ...
    fn main() {
        let mut root = Node::new("root");
        root.insert("one");
        root.insert("two");
        root.insert("four");

        println!("root {:#?}",root);
    }
```

Note the `match` - we're pulling out a mutable reference to the box, if the `Option`
is `Some`, and applying the `insert` method. Otherwise, we need to create a new `Node`
for the left side and so forth.

And here's the output tree:

```
root Node {
    payload: "root",
    left: Some(
        Node {
            payload: "one",
            left: Some(
                Node {
                    payload: "four",
                    left: None,
                    right: None
                }
            ),
            right: None
        }
    ),
    right: Some(
        Node {
            payload: "two",
            left: None,
            right: None
        }
    )
}
```
The strings that are 'less' than other strings get put down the left side, otherwise
the right side.

Time for a visit. This is _in-order traversal_ - we visit the left, do something on
the node, and then visit the right.

```rust
    fn visit(&self) {
        if let Some(ref left) = self.left {
            left.visit();
        }
        println!("'{}'",self.payload);
        if let Some(ref right) = self.right {
            right.visit();
        }
    }
    ...
    ...
    root.visit();
    // 'four'
    // 'one'
    // 'root'
    // 'two'
```
So we're visiting the strings in order! Please note the reappearance of `ref` - `if let`
uses exactly the same rules as `match`.

`Box` is a _smart_ pointer; note that no 'unboxing' was needed to call
`Node` methods on it!

## Generic Functions

The operation of squaring a number is _generic_ in that `x*x` will work for integers,
floats and generally for anything that knows about the multiplication operator `*`.

This Just Happens in dynamic languages because the arguments carry their type, and the
runtime will then call the appropriate multiply operator - or fail miserably.
(Which is always the painful thing about dynamic languages.)

The Rust solution is a _generic function_, which has _type parameters_.

```rust
// gen1.rs

fn sqr<T> (x: T) -> T {
    x*x
}

fn main() {
    let res = sqr(10.0);
    println!("res {}",res);
}
```
However, Rust is not C++ - it's not going to let you do this without knowing _something_
about `T`:

```
error[E0369]: binary operation `*` cannot be applied to type `T`
 --> gen1.rs:4:5
  |
4 |     x*x
  |     ^
  |
note: an implementation of `std::ops::Mul` might be missing for `T`
 --> gen1.rs:4:5
  |
4 |     x*x
  |     ^
```
Following the advice of the compiler, let's _constrain_ that type parameter using
that trait, which is used to implement the multiplication operator `*`:
(`T: Mul` means 'any type T that implements Mul')

```rust
use std::ops::Mul;

fn sqr<T: Mul> (x: T) -> T {
    x*x
}
```

Which still doesn't work:

```
rror[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> gen2.rs:6:5
  |
6 |     x*x
  |     ^^^ expected type parameter, found associated type
  |
  = note: expected type `T`
  = note:    found type `<T as std::ops::Mul>::Output`
```
What `rustc` is saying that the type of `x*x` is `T::Output`, not `T`. There's actually
no reason that the type of `x*x` is the same as the type of `x`, e.g. the dot product
of two vectors is a scalar.

```rust
fn sqr<T: Mul> (x: T) -> T::Output {
    x*x
}
```

and now the error is:

```
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
 --> gen2.rs:6:7
  |
6 |     x*x
  |     - ^ value used here after move
  |     |
  |     value moved here
  |
  = note: move occurs because `x` has type `T`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
```

So, we need to constrain the type even further!

```rust
fn sqr<T: Mul + Copy> (x: T) -> T::Output {
    x*x
}
```
And that (finally) works. Calmly listening to the compiler will often get you closer
to the magic point when ... things compile cleanly.

It _is_ a bit simpler in C++:

```cpp
template <typename T>
T sqr(x: T) {
    return x*x;
}
```
but (to be honest) C++ is adopting cowboy tactics here. C++ template errors are famously
bad, because all the compiler knows (ultimately) is that some operator or method is
not defined. The C++ committee knows this is a problem and so they are working
toward [concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_(C%2B%2B)), which are pretty
much like trait-constrained type parameters in Rust.

Rust generic functions may look a bit overwhelming at first, but being explicit means
you will know exactly what kind of values you can safely feed it.

These functions are called _monomorphic_, in constrast to _polymorphic_. The body of
the function is compiled separately for each unique type.  With polymorphic functions,
the same machine code works with each matching type, dynamically _dispatching_
the correct method.

 Monomorphic produces faster code,
specialized for the particular type, and can often be _inlined_.  So when `sqr(x)` is
seen, it's effectively replaced with `x*x`.  The downside is that large generic
functions produce a lot of code, for each type used, which can result in _code bloat_.
As always, there are trade-offs; an experienced person learns to make the right choice
for the job.


## Generic Structs

Consider the example of a binary tree. It would be _seriously irritating_ to
have to rewrite it for all possible kinds of payload. Before C++ templates, people
would do truly awful things with the C preprocessor to write 'generic' classes.

So here's our generic `Node` with its _type parameter_ `T`. It's fairly similar to
a C++ template struct.

```rust
type NodeBox<T> = Option<Box<Node<T>>>;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node<T> {
    payload: T,
    left: NodeBox<T>,
    right: NodeBox<T>
}
```

The implementation shows the difference between the languages. The fundamental operation
on the payload is comparison, so T must be comparable with `<`, i.e. implements `PartialOrd`.
The type parameter must be declared in the `impl` block with its constraints:


```rust
impl <T: PartialOrd> Node<T> {
    fn new(s: T) -> Node<T> {
        Node{payload: s, left: None, right: None}
    }

    fn boxer(node: Node<T>) -> NodeBox<T> {
        Some(Box::new(node))
    }

    fn set_left(&mut self, node: Node<T>) {
        self.left = Self::boxer(node);
    }

    fn set_right(&mut self, node: Node<T>) {
        self.right = Self::boxer(node);
    }

    fn insert(&mut self, data: T) {
        if data < self.payload {
            match self.left {
            Some(ref mut n) => n.insert(data),
            None => self.set_left(Self::new(data)),
            }
        } else {
            match self.right {
            Some(ref mut n) => n.insert(data),
            None => self.set_right(Self::new(data)),
            }
        }
    }
}


fn main() {
    let mut root = Node::new("root".to_string());
    root.insert("one".to_string());
    root.insert("two".to_string());
    root.insert("four".to_string());

    println!("root {:#?}",root);
}
```

So generic structs need their type parameter(s) specified
in angle brackets, like C++. Unlike C++, Rust is usually smart enough to work out
that type parameter from context. But you do need to constrain that type appropriately!
